## General info
####  The purpose of this app is to connect blood donors with those in need of a blood donation. After creating an account and log in, a user can create a blood request. The request will contain some info about the patient(name, age, blood type, compatible blood types), about his location(the nearest blood bank, address, phone number) and a phone number for contact. After creating the request, the user will be able to find eligible donors nearby and send them a notification on their phone, asking for their help.
####  Blood donors can see the requests and they can make an appointment in the app. A reminder will be sent to their phone before the appointment. After they complete the donation process, they can scan a QR Code to confirm it in the app. The last donation date will be saved into the database and the user will no longer be able to make appointments, until after 2-3 months(the required time between donations). In this period of time, users can share the requests on different platforms.
####  The app contains also a list with all the donation centers in the country, with all the information you can need. Users can make appointments at a certain donation center, not necessarily for someone in particular.
